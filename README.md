# Shells for ASTM Grasp Strength of Robotic Hands
3D models of shells for standardized objects compatible with ATI-IA MINI45 and NANO17 force sensors.

Instructions:<br>
Simply print the desired shells with your favorite 3d printing machine. Fine layers are recommended (0.1-0.2 mm). No support material required, see AllShells_3DPrinting.3mf

NANO17 18mm Shell Assembly:<br>
Assemble all components, use 6 M2x5 socket head screws.<br>

Attach first half shell with 3 screws. <span style="color:red">**DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN THE SCREWS!**</span>
You can damage the force sensors if excessive torque is applied.<br>
